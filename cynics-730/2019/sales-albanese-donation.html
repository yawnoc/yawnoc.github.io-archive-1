<p class="dialogue-host">
Anthony Albanese, thank you for coming in.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="anthony-albanese-20190903.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ALBANESE">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Good to be with you, Leigh.

<p class="dialogue-host">
On another matter, the corruption hearings into donations
to the New South Wales Labor Party are continuing.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-host">
The reaction of federal MPs, including yourself,
has been shock and disbelief,
as if the party's headquarters and its elected MPs are church and state.
That's a bit hard for the average voter to believe, isn't it,
that Labor MPs have no idea about the culture or operation
of your party headquarters and the way it gets money?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="anthony-albanese-20190903.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ALBANESE">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, quite clearly, people didn't know about it, quite frankly, Leigh.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{Except Kaila Murnain of course, but she's dead to us now,
so she doesn't count as a person.}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
If you knew about it you would have been reporting on it,
on this very program.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20190903.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host thought">
{All right Mr&nbsp;Smarty-pants it's just the first question.}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-host">
But I'm not a key elected official of the Labor Party.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="anthony-albanese-20190903.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ALBANESE">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
I didn't even know this function had occurred.
I'd never met the particular official and didn't know he existed,
who was involved in this, and of course, Kaila Murnain has paid a price.
She's been suspended from her position.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
What we need to do is to make sure that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Commission_Against_Corruption_(New_South_Wales)" title="Wikipedia: Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales)">ICAC</a>
can undertake its work.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
There's clearly a need for structural reform in the New South Wales branch,
to make sure this can never happen again.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20190903.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
Shouldn't there be an audit,
not just of the New South Wales branch, but of all branches,
because if it's going on here, how do we know it's not going on elsewhere?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="anthony-albanese-20190903.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ALBANESE">
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{Yes of course there should, but I'm not allowed to say that.
So cue swipe at the Coalition:}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, the Labor Party federally, of course, we,
unlike the Government: we declare all donations above $1,000
which is what we think the threshold should be.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
That's been resisted by the current Coalition Government, and of course
in New South Wales, 10, no less than 10 Liberal Party MPs
either had to resign from Parliament or go to the crossbench [...].
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20190903.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
But we're talking about Labor.
Why not be transparent and have an audit? Bring out independent auditors.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="anthony-albanese-20190903.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ALBANESE">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
We have processes
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{which we would like to keep in house for obvious reasons}.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
We have an audit process.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20190903.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
Well, it clearly hasn't worked.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="anthony-albanese-20190903.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ALBANESE">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
We have an audit process of our federal funding as a national party.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
What we need to do, is, in New South Wales
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{and definitely not in Federal Labor},
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
there clearly needs to be a proper examination of how this occurred,
and a restructuring to make sure that it can't occur again.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20190903.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
Why just New South Wales though?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="anthony-albanese-20190903.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ALBANESE">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
But we need to ... because it is in New South Wales that this has occurred
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{and assuredly, I say to you, not in Federal Labor}.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20190903.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
But how do you know?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="anthony-albanese-20190903.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ALBANESE">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
In terms of, federally, ...
Because federally we have an absolutely strong audit process
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{although if you asked me to explain exactly what makes it stronger than
the New South Wales branch's audit process, I wouldn't be able to}.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20190903.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
Is the party culture to do whatever it takes
to get as much money as possible through the doors?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="anthony-albanese-20190903.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ALBANESE">
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{Oh yes, and it's one of the few things for which
there's bipartisan consensus too.}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, look, it's up to the New South Wales branch officials to comment
and they've been doing that, of course,
before the ICAC and that will continue to take place over coming weeks
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{and until it's over I shall be using the nifty
"I can't comment on matters relating to an ongoing investigation"}.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
We need to not pre-empt that, Leigh.
It's important; one of the issues is re political interference
in proper processes.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
There is a process, the ICAC, and what we shouldn't do is
try and politically interfere with that while that process is ongoing.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{However, if we are talking about political interference
in the form of donations from those linked to the Chinese Communist Party,
I think we agree with the Liberals: How good's money?}
