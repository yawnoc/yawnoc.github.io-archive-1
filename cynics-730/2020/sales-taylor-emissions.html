<p class="dialogue-host">
Minister, thanks for your time.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR, ENERGY MINISTER">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Thanks for having me, Leigh.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-host">

<p class="dialogue-guest">
[...]
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
On energy policy,
is the Federal Government going to pay
to keep the Liddell power station open,
the one that AGL wants to close in 2023?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{Blame media for asking questions and go to talking points:}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, I think everyone's getting a bit ahead of themselves here
with some speculative reporting, Leigh.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
[...] the way to get prices down to ensure [...]
affordable reliable energy
and [that] industry in Australia continues to prosper and be successful...
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
I notice you're not answering the question.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
... in the future is to get [...]
more supply into the market and avoid supply leaving.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
Are you going to pay to keep the Liddell power station open?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
So I'm not going to speculate on the outcomes of the Liddell Taskforce
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{because I already have a good idea of what they will be,
given what the Taskforce is supposed to be examining}.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
[...]
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
What do you think is the timeframe
for Australia to transition away from coal?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{The same time as it would take
for every human alive today to be turned into fossil fuel.}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, I mean, it's not about coal, it's about emissions.
[...] we need to play our part in helping to reduce global emissions.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
But I'm actually not asking about emissions,
I just want to ask about coal because
AGL says coal should be done in about 50&nbsp;years.
[...] South&nbsp;32, BHP, Rio Tinto, they're getting away from coal now.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-host">
[...] as a relevant minister, what do you think is the timeframe
in which Australia is going to be getting away from coal?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, I understand you're asking that question but
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{I want to talk about emissions today and not coal,
even though normally I would want to talk about coal and not emissions,
and}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
the point I'm making to you is it's about emissions
and emissions come from much more than coal
and they come from much more than the electricity sector...
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{including farting livestock,
as comrade Barnaby already discussed
in a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx9FFWxbVCc" title="Barnaby Joyce and Joel Fitzgibbon clash at joint media conference in Parliament House | 7NEWS">pleasant chat</a>
with Joel Fitzgibbon last week}.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
But I'm asking about coal. I'm just narrowly asking about coal.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
... I know you are
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{i.e.&nbsp;I am effectively giving you the finger}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
and my point is there's [sic] many ways to reduce emissions.
[...] 2020 targets we'll beat easily,
2030 targets, <em>and</em> driving emissions beyond that.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{Driving emissions <em>downwards</em>, not upwards I think.}
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
On your point that the 2030 targets we'll meet easily,
what's your source for that?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, the government department. I mean, we are on track already...
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
But exactly which government department is saying that
because I've got figures from various government departments?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
My government department. [...]
We've got a plan laid out to the last tonne
as to how we are going to reach our emissions targets
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{a completely inapt rhetorical device,
given that mass is a continuous quantity}.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
[...]
</p>
<p class="dialogue-host">
[...]
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
[...]
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
Do you still maintain
that the falsified document that your office distributed
about the Sydney City Council's travel bill
came from its own website?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Yes, I mean my statement on this was clear from the start
and I'd add to that, Leigh...
</p>
<p class="dialogue-host">
[...]
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
[...] This has been considered and closed by two independent police forces.
We had the AFP Commissioner today saying
the matter is finalised, full stop.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{Although my office really really really did nothing wrong,
thank Christ the investigation is over.
Who cares about the <em>real</em> culprit over at Sydney City Council?}
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
How do you explain the inconsistency
between your story and the metadata produced by the Sydney City Council
showing that the document as distributed never appeared on their website?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, that's a matter for them. [...]
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{It's definitely their fault,
but for some reason I don't want an investigation.}
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
But aren't you bothered [...]?
You have had a lot of trouble because of this and I'm just wondering,
aren't you curious yourself as to what that inconsistency is?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Leigh, we've had two independent police forces look at this.
[...]
They have both considered and closed this matter and as I said,
the AFP Commissioner today said that the matter is finalised, full stop
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{which makes two full stops}.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
[...]
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
But the New South Wales Police referred the matter to the AFP;
the AFP dropped its investigation.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-host">
Today the commissioner told a senate estimates committee that
the police did <em>not</em> interview the Sydney Lord Mayor;
they also didn't interview you.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-host">
Given that what happened damaged your reputation, [...]
you must be disappointed at the lack of a thorough investigation?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Haha, Leigh, two police forces have looked at this.
It's been pretty thorough
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{or about as thorough as the look I gave
those highly reasonable spending figures in that document
which my office had absolutely nothing to do with}...
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
They didn't interview you, they didn't interview the Lord Mayor?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, that was a choice they made
but it's very clear what the position is here.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
The commissioner [...] was very clear:
it's been finalised and the matter is closed, full stop
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{which makes three full stops}.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-host">
[...]
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
[...]
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
I keep coming back to this. [...]
You are [...] the face of it, [...] at the front-line of it.
Why aren't you worried about it?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Because I've made a very clear statement on it
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{namely "My office and I totally did nothing wrong",}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
[... t]wo police forces have looked at it [and] the matter's closed
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{which is the perfect outcome for me, the innocent one in all of this.
I am eternally grateful to the police commissioner
for delivering true justice}.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
[...]
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="leigh-sales-20200302.jpg" alt="LEIGH SALES">
<p class="dialogue-host">
Minister, thank you very much for joining us this evening.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="angus-taylor-20200302.jpg" alt="ANGUS TAYLOR">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Thanks for having me, Leigh.
