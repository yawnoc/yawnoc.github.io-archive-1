What do you do in your spare time?
</h3>
<p>
That depends on what you mean by spare time; a day is quite short really.
Generally speaking life is very short too.
Eighty years is not a very long time to (expect to) be alive,
and even eight hundred years would pass me by very quickly.
</p>
<h3 id="spare-time-no-dodge"><a class="self-link" href="#spare-time-no-dodge"></a>
Without dodging, what do you do in your spare time?
</h3>
<p>
I ponder unsophisticated
<a href="#applied" title="Applied mathematics, or physics">applied maths problems</a>
and attempt to read
<a href="#literary" title="English translations of Literary Chinese">Literary Chinese</a>.
I guess now I am burning even more of my time by building this website
and making this content freely available online.
</p>
<h3 id="site"><a class="self-link" href="#site"></a>
How is this site built?
</h3>
<p>
Using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>,
which is
<span class="green"><b>simple</b></span>,
<span class="green"><b>fast</b></span> and most importantly
<span class="green"><b>ad-free</b></span>
(but unfortunately conway.github.io was already taken, sob).
I definitely recommend it for building a static website.
And no, I do not use Jekyll or other plugins;
just straight CSS and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
The pages are written in my own "concise HTML" (<code>.cch</code>),
which gets converted to standard HTML (<code>.html</code>) via my custom-written
<a href="/code/cch-to-html.html" title="Python: a regex converter from CCH to HTML">Python converter</a>.
For example, this page was generated from the CCH file
<a href="https://github.com/yawnoc/yawnoc.github.io/blob/master/pages/faq.cch" title="faq.cch"><code>faq.cch</code></a>.
</p>
<h3 id="custom-domain"><a class="self-link" href="#custom-domain"></a>
Why don't you get yourself a custom domain
instead of the default yawnoc.github.io?
</h3>
<p>
Firstly, I am poor, and secondly, even if I did buy a domain,
I can't keep it with me when I die. On the other hand,
the default subdomain is as permanent as GitHub Pages itself.
</p>
<h3 id="death"><a class="self-link" href="#death"></a>
Oh... that's a bit macabre... (or, I wish you didn't mention death)
</h3>
<p>
I do not fear death for my own sake.
I might die some time later today, or I may have many decades yet.
At the time of writing the latter is more probable. Fear changes nothing.
</p>
<h3 id="broken-no-javascript"><a class="self-link" href="#broken-no-javascript"></a>
Why are citation date, maths equations &amp; romanisation toggling broken?
</h3>
<p>
JavaScript is required. Tests for your browser:

Applied mathematics, or physics

<p>
The <a href="/#applied" title="Applied mathematics, or physics">applied maths</a>
I am interested in is really physics, specifically
problems in the Newtonian regime which can be modelled in a continuum manner,
with none of the complications of quantum mechanics (which I do not understand)
and relativity.

English translations of Literary Chinese
</h2>
<p>
In any regional variant of Chinese, there is a continuum between
<span lang="zh-Hant">白話</span> (vernacular Chinese; literally "plain talk") and <span lang="zh-Hant">文言</span>
(Literary Chinese, or Classical Chinese; literally "literary speech").
<span lang="zh-Hant">文言</span> is extremely concise, and prone to dropping things
which can be inferred by context.
It is very difficult to read because
Chinese characters have many meanings which are now archaic.
For example, the character <span lang="zh-Hant">之</span> retains only two meanings in modern usage
(though the second is rare and very formal):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
reverse of "of",
so that "A&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">之</span>&nbsp;B"
means "B&nbsp;of&nbsp;A"
</li>
<li>
any non-subject pronoun (him, it, etc.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
However in literary Chinese, <span lang="zh-Hant">之</span> can also be
</p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">此也：</span>
this (as in <span lang="zh-Hant">之子：</span>this daughter)
</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">往也：</span>
go (as in <span lang="zh-Hant">東之：</span>went east)
</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">至也：</span>
until (as in <span lang="zh-Hant">之死：</span>until death)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
among other meanings.
There is also the interchangeable use of certain characters, e.g.&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">女</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">汝</span> (thou),
<span lang="zh-Hant">邪</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">耶</span> (a speech-assist word indicating a question),
<span lang="zh-Hant">反</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">返</span> (return),
<span lang="zh-Hant">矜</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">鰥</span> (widower), etc.
I also note that <span lang="zh-Hant">文言</span> was originally written with no punctuation
and very little paragraphing, and that in all the resources we read today,
an editor has already gone ahead and inserted the punctuation for us.
</p>
<p>
Recently I got the idea of 
<a href="/#literary" title="English translations of Literary Chinese">translating</a>
some of the texts which I have been reading into English.
</p>
<h3 id="italics"><a class="self-link" href="#italics"></a>
Why are there italicised words in your translations?
</h3>
<p>
I strive for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence" title="Wikipedia: Dynamic and formal equivalence">formal equivalence</a>
in my translations, and I adopt the convention of the
King&nbsp;James Bible translators, who <i>distinguished</i> words
which did not appear in the original Hebrew, Aramaic or Greek
(though in the original 1611 version this was done not using italics,
but using Roman type against Black Letter type).
In my case, English words which do not appear in the original Chinese
(meaning I cannot point to a character which corresponds to
or contains that word) are <i>distinguished</i>, except:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
"The" is not emphasised when referring to a general class
as opposed to a particular instance, e.g.&nbsp;"the poor".
</li>
<li>
"Of" is not emphasised unless part an entire phrase
not in the original Chinese,
and is thought of as being provided by the word order in Chinese.
</li>
<li>
Prepositions are not emphasised when they follow a verb,
and are thought of as part of the verb in Chinese,
e.g.&nbsp;"went to", "laughed at".
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="archaic-verbs"><a class="self-link" href="#archaic-verbs"></a>
Wherefore usest thou archaic verb conjugation?
</h3>
<p>
This is stylistic, and in my view
accurately reflects the archaicness of Literary Chinese.
</p>
<p>
Also it sounds cooler and allows for greater freedom in word order.
For example, compare
"This is what the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> says" (New International Version)
to
"Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>" (King&nbsp;James Version).
</p>
<h3 id="see-yaa"><a class="self-link" href="#see-yaa"></a>
But I thought that <span lang="zh-Hant">是</span> means "is", and <span lang="zh-Hant">也</span>, "also".
</h3>
<p>
Forget everything you learnt in Mandarin class; that is modern vernacular.
Welcome to pre-twentieth-century Chinese Literature, in which
<span lang="zh-Hant">是</span> primarily means "this", and <span lang="zh-Hant">也</span> is primarily an ending
speech-assist word (with no inherent meaning) which asserts
the preceding thing/notion/statement.
</p>
<p>
In Hong Kong you might see <span lang="zh-Hant">是日例湯</span> written on a chalkboard
for soup at an eatery.
Here <span lang="zh-Hant"><span class="magenta">是</span>日</span> means "<span class="magenta">this</span> day", i.e.&nbsp;"today".
</p>
<h3 id="faan-ch'eet"><a class="self-link" href="#faan-ch'eet"></a>
A certain <span lang="zh-Hant">反切</span> doesn't work for Mandarin.
</h3>
<p>
Too bad. Usually I use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanqie" title="Wikipedia: Fanqie"><span lang="zh-Hant">反切</span></a>
from the old rime dictionaries.
When this is inconsistent with modern Cantonese I modify it,
but I can't always make it work for Mandarin as well
due to phonological shifts (e.g.&nbsp;Mandarin has lost the ending consonants
<span class="no-wrapping">-m</span>, <span class="no-wrapping">-p</span>,
<span class="no-wrapping">-t</span> and <span class="no-wrapping">-k</span>).
Also there is <span lang="zh-Hant">統讀</span>, or Government-regulated Mandarin.
</p>
<h3 id="t'ung-tuk"><a class="self-link" href="#t'ung-tuk"></a>
What is <span lang="zh-Hant">統讀</span>, or Government-regulated Mandarin?
</h3>
<p>
These are government-regulated Mandarin pronunciations
in Mainlandia since 1985,
where pronunciations of certain characters have been merged or changed.
For example, <span lang="zh-Hant">勝</span> has two pronunciations for two meanings:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span lang="zh-Hant">平聲</span>&nbsp;(level tone);<br>
homophone of&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">升</span>,
<a href="/pages/conway-cantonese-romanisation.html" title="Conway's Custom Romanisation for Cantonese">Cantonese</a>:&nbsp;sing1,
Mandarin&nbsp;shēng<br>
meaning "able (to bear)"<br>
as in <span lang="zh-Hant">勝任：</span>able to bear <i>the</i> responsibility/role
</li>
<li>
<span lang="zh-Hant">去聲</span>&nbsp;(departing tone);<br>
homophone of&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">聖</span>,
<a href="/pages/conway-cantonese-romanisation.html" title="Conway's Custom Romanisation for Cantonese">Cantonese</a>:&nbsp;sing3,
Mandarin&nbsp;shèng<br>
meaning "victory"<br>
as in <span lang="zh-Hant">勝負：</span>wins <i>and</i> losses
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But in Mandarin on the mainland, they are both "supposed to be" read
in departing tone (shèng).
For an analogy, the English word "tear" has two pronunciations,
rhyming with "dare" and with "dear";
now imagine having to say "tare drop" instead of "tear drop".
It is a real pity that the nuances of the Chinese language
are lost in government-regulated Mandarin; tone patterns (<span lang="zh-Hant">平仄</span>) are ruined.
On the other hand if I pronounced <span lang="zh-Hant">勝任</span> in Cantonese with <span lang="zh-Hant">勝</span> in departing tone,
I would certainly be mocked as illiterate
(though to be honest, I am only barely literate, if literate at all).
</p>
<h3 id="see-sing"><a class="self-link" href="#see-sing"></a>
What do you mean by <span lang="zh-Hant">四聲</span>, four tones?
</h3>
<p>
I <b>do not</b> mean the four tones of modern Mandarin,
but instead the <b>four classical tone classes</b> of Chinese:
</p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">平</span>&nbsp;(level)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">上</span>&nbsp;(rising)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">去</span>&nbsp;(departing)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">入</span>&nbsp;(entering)</li>
</ol>
<p>
From the perspective of Western linguistics, entering tones
are not separate tones because they are syllables which end abruptly
in <span class="no-wrapping">-p</span>, <span class="no-wrapping">-t</span>
or <span class="no-wrapping">-k</span>,
but classically the distinction is important.
In poetry you want a good balance of words in
<span lang="zh-Hant">平聲</span> (level tone) and <span lang="zh-Hant">仄聲</span> (sloping tone, i.e.&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">上去入</span>).
Here it suffices for you to know that <b>Mandarin has no entering tones</b>;
its tones are:
</p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">陰平</span>&nbsp;(dark level)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">陽平</span>&nbsp;(light level)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">上</span>&nbsp;(rising)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">去</span>&nbsp;(departing)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Although Mandarin has four tones numerically,
they only fall under the first <b>three</b> classical tone classes.
Those of you familiar with Mandarin will notice that
tone&nbsp;2, light level, is actually rising in pitch,
and tone&nbsp;3, rising, is more of a dip or depression;
indeed phonology has changed by a lot over the ages.
Cantonese has done a better job of preserving the abrupt consonant endings
of the entering tones, and it still has level and rising tones which are
level and rising in pitch respectively.
Altogether there are nine tones numerically, covering all four classes:
</p>
<ol>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">陰平</span>&nbsp;(dark level)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">陰上</span>&nbsp;(dark rising)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">陰去</span>&nbsp;(dark departing)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">陽平</span>&nbsp;(light level)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">陽上</span>&nbsp;(light rising)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">陽去</span>&nbsp;(light departing)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">高陰入</span>&nbsp;(upper dark entering)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">低陰入</span>&nbsp;(lower dark entering)</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">陽入</span>&nbsp;(light entering)</li>
</ol>
