<p class="dialogue-host">
Gladys, thank you so much for your time.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-host">
Can I just start: were you on the committee of
two chapters of the China Overseas Exchange Association:
one in Guangdong, from between 2003 and 2015, and the other in Shandong?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="gladys-liu-20190910.jpg" alt="GLADYS LIU">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, good to be with you Andrew.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
I can tell you that, I cannot recall, as is reported,
that from 2003 to 2015, twelve years long, that if I can't recall,
I can't be an active member of that council, can I.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{However, my memory shall be magically restored within the next 24&nbsp;hours,
and I shall release a statement tomorrow, even Wednesday the 11th,
confirming that I was a member of the
Guangdong Overseas Exchange Association in&nbsp;2011.

You've been Honorary President also,
of the Australia Jiangmen General Commerce Association.
It has backed China's theft of the South China Sea.
Was your Association wrong to support that theft?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="gladys-liu-20190910.jpg" alt="GLADYS LIU">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Well, as the Honorary President of the organisation,
that they didn't tell me everything that they do
[...] they want to use your fame,
they want you to attend their functions,
[...] to lift the profile of their organisation and their event.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Definitely, there was no information to me, what they do day to day,
and I have no knowledge [...].
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{So there I was in an honorary leadersip role,
happy to attend their functions and lift their profile,
and content with them exploiting my name, in return for having
absolutely no knowledge of the actual operations of the Association;
what the hell was I even doing there, and how naive/stupid can I be eh?}

[...] Can I just hear, you were also Honorary President of the
United Chinese Commerce Association.
Now there is evidence that this too is connected to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_Work_Department" title="Wikipedia: United Front Work Department">United Front (Work Department)</a>:
true or not?

What is that organisation again? I don't think I am. [...]

You have been Honorary President of the United Chinese Commerce Association

Can you now tell us, in what way should Australia
be more friendly to China? Can you give some examples?

Well... that is what our Foreign Minister has been doing very well,
and she has been looking at the relationship between all countries,
and she has been talking for the interests of Australia with other
Foreign Ministers.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{And by "the interests of Australia" I of course mean
"the interests of Australia's government".}

Can I just end by just asking you a couple of things:
Xi Jinping has made himself dictator for life;
he is cracking down on dissidents, human rights activists;
he has imprisoned Christians;
he has imprisoned Uyghurs in re-education camps;
he's threatening Taiwan;
do your consider Xi Jinping a dictator?
</p>

{Let me just melt into a puddle...}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Umm... well honestly I have been focusing on serving the seat of Chisholm
[...] I don't really know and I don't really...
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="andrew-bolt-20190910.jpg" alt="ANDREW BOLT">
<p class="dialogue-host">
Gladys, excuse me. You were born in Hong Kong;
at the moment you have seen in your home place,
people in their millions at times, 1.7 million, in their millions,
protesting against what China's doing there,
and you don't have any opinion on Xi Jinping?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="gladys-liu-20190910.jpg" alt="GLADYS LIU">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
OK. [...] In terms of Hong Kong,
it is very very sad for anyone to see what has happened.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{This is of course a carefully selected statement which keeps me
on the fence, because at the same time:
(a)&nbsp;the pro-democracy protesters are in a most depressing situation; and
(b)&nbsp;pro-Beijing folks will lament about disorder and violence,
by conveniently forgetting about the infinitely worse
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1967_leftist_riots" title="Wikipedia: Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots">1967 pro-commie riots</a>
which they championed at the time,
in which there were real bombs which blew people up, including children.}
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="andrew-bolt-20190910.jpg" alt="ANDREW BOLT">
<p class="dialogue-host">
But Gladys, simple question: is Xi Jinping a dictator?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="gladys-liu-20190910.jpg" alt="GLADYS LIU">
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{I remain a puddle.}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
That is not a question for me to answer.
But I can tell you about Hong Kong, it is very very sad to see...
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="andrew-bolt-20190910.jpg" alt="ANDREW BOLT">
<p class="dialogue-host">
I don't want to know about Hong Kong; I'm asking you about Xi Jinping,
the dictator of Communist China, and you don't have an opinion about him?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="gladys-liu-20190910.jpg" alt="GLADYS LIU">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
I do have an opinion, but I'm not going to use the word "dictator"
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{because, having joined the Australian government,
I am now obliged to cower in submission
and not offend the Communist Party,
because money}.
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
He is, in their system, an elected Chairman, or President,
they call it, for China.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="andrew-bolt-20190910.jpg" alt="ANDREW BOLT">
<p class="dialogue-host">
Gladys Liu, are you, in effect, a spokesman
for the Chinese Communist regime in Australia?
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="gladys-liu-20190910.jpg" alt="GLADYS LIU">
<p class="dialogue-guest thought">
{Aren't we all, except Andrew Hastie and a few others?}
</p>
<p class="dialogue-guest">
The simple answer is no. As I said...
</p>
<img class="dialogue-host" src="andrew-bolt-20190910.jpg" alt="ANDREW BOLT">
<p class="dialogue-host">
Gladys Liu, thank you so much indeed for your time.
</p>
<img class="dialogue-guest" src="gladys-liu-20190910.jpg" alt="GLADYS LIU">
<p class="dialogue-guest">
Thank you Andrew.
