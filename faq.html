What do you do in your spare time?
</h3>
<p>
That depends on what you mean by spare time; a day is quite short really.
Generally speaking life is very short too.
Eighty years is not a very long time to (expect to) be alive,
and even eight hundred years would pass me by very quickly.
</p>
<p>
I ponder unsophisticated
<a href="#applied" title="Applied mathematics, or physics">applied maths problems</a>
and attempt to read
<a href="#literary" title="English translations of Literary Chinese">Literary Chinese</a>.
Now I am burning even more of my time by building this website
and making the content freely available online.
</p>
<h3 id="site"><a class="self-link" href="#site"></a>
How is this site built?
</h3>
<p>
Using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a>,
which is
<span class="green"><b>simple</b></span>,
<span class="green"><b>fast</b></span> and most importantly
<span class="green"><b>ad-free</b></span>
(but unfortunately conway.github.io was already taken, sob).
I definitely recommend it for building a static website.
In my case, I do not use Jekyll or other plugins;
just straight CSS and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
The pages are written in my own "concise HTML" (<code>.cch</code>),
which gets converted to standard HTML (<code>.html</code>) via my custom-written
<a href="/code/cch" title="Python: a regex converter from CCH to HTML">Python converter</a>.
For example, this page was generated from the CCH file
<a href="https://github.com/yawnoc/yawnoc.github.io/blob/master/faq.cch" title="faq.cch"><code>faq.cch</code></a>.
</p>
<h3 id="domain"><a class="self-link" href="#domain"></a>
Why don't you get yourself a custom domain
instead of the default yawnoc.github.io?
</h3>
<p>
Firstly, I am poor, and secondly, even if I did buy a domain,
I can't keep it with me when I die. On the other hand,
the default subdomain is as permanent as GitHub Pages itself.
</p>
<h3 id="death"><a class="self-link" href="#death"></a>
Oh... that's a bit macabre.
</h3>
<p>
I do not fear death for my own sake.
I might die some time later today, or I may have many decades yet.
At the time of writing the latter is more probable. Fear changes nothing.
</p>
<h3 id="cookies"><a class="self-link" href="#cookies"></a>
Does your site use cookies?
</h3>
<p>
A single cookie called <code>romanisation</code> is used
to remember your romanisation preference.
Unless you tamper with it, its value will only be one of
<code>none</code>, <code>conway</code>, <code>wadegiles</code> or <code>pinyin</code>.
I do not track you.
</p>
<p class="note">
Cookie banners/pop-ups are stupid. Sue me.<br>

Applied mathematics, or physics
</h2>
<p>
The <a href="/#applied" title="Applied mathematics, or physics">applied maths</a>
I am interested in is really physics,
specifically problems in the Newtonian regime
which can be modelled in a continuum manner,
with none of the complications of
quantum mechanics (which I do not understand)
and relativity.
</p>
<h3 id="equations"><a class="self-link" href="#equations"></a>
How are the maths equations rendered?
</h3>
<p>
Using KaTeX. See

English translations of Literary Chinese
</h2>
<p>
In any regional variant of Chinese, there is a continuum between
<span lang="zh-Hant">白話</span> (vernacular Chinese; literally "plain talk") and <span lang="zh-Hant">文言</span>
(Literary Chinese, or Classical Chinese; literally "literary speech").
Literary is extremely concise, and prone to dropping things
which can be inferred by context.
It is very difficult to read because
Chinese characters have many meanings which are now archaic.
For example, the character <span lang="zh-Hant">之</span> retains only two meanings in modern usage
(though the second is rare and very formal):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
reverse of "of",
so that "A&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">之</span>&nbsp;B"
means "B&nbsp;of&nbsp;A"
</li>
<li>
any non-subject pronoun (him, it, etc.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
However in literary Chinese, <span lang="zh-Hant">之</span> can also be
</p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">此也：</span>
this (as in <span lang="zh-Hant">之子：</span>this daughter)
</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">往也：</span>
go (as in <span lang="zh-Hant">東之：</span>went east)
</li>
<li><span lang="zh-Hant">至也：</span>
until (as in <span lang="zh-Hant">之死：</span>until death)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
among other meanings.
There is also the interchangeable use of certain characters, e.g.&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">女</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">汝</span> (thou),
<span lang="zh-Hant">邪</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">耶</span> (a speech-assist word indicating a question),
<span lang="zh-Hant">反</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">返</span> (return),
<span lang="zh-Hant">矜</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span lang="zh-Hant">鰥</span> (widower), etc.
I also note that Literary was originally written with no punctuation
and very little paragraphing, and that in all the resources we read today,
an editor has already gone ahead and inserted the punctuation for us.
</p>
<p>
Recently I got the idea of
<a href="/#literary" title="English translations of Literary Chinese">translating</a>
some of the texts which I have been reading into English.
</p>
<h3 id="italics"><a class="self-link" href="#italics"></a>
Why are there italicised words in your translations?
</h3>
<p>
I aim for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence" title="Wikipedia: Dynamic and formal equivalence">formal equivalence</a>
in my translations, and I adopt the convention of the
King&nbsp;James Bible translators, who <i>distinguished</i> words
which did not appear in the original Hebrew, Aramaic or Greek
(note that in the original 1611 version this was done not using italics,
but using Roman type instead of the main Black Letter type).
In my case, English words which do not appear in the original Chinese
(meaning I cannot point to a character which corresponds to
or contains that word) are <i>distinguished</i>, except:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
"The" is not distinguished when referring to a general class
as opposed to a particular instance, e.g.&nbsp;"the poor".
</li>
<li>
"Of" is not distinguished unless part an entire phrase
not in the original Chinese,
and is thought of as being provided by the word order in Chinese.
</li>
<li>
Prepositions are not distinguished when they follow a verb,
and are thought of as part of the verb in Chinese,
e.g.&nbsp;"went to", "laughed at".
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="archaic"><a class="self-link" href="#archaic"></a>
Wherefore usest thou archaic verb conjugation?
</h3>
<p>
This is stylistic, and in my view
accurately reflects the archaicness of Literary Chinese.
</p>
<p>
Also it sounds cooler and allows for greater freedom in word order.
For example, compare
"This is what the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> says" (New International Version)
to
"Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>" (King&nbsp;James Version)
for the Hebrew
<span lang="he" dir="rtl" class="no-wrapping">כה אמר יהוה</span>.
</p>
<h3 id="this"><a class="self-link" href="#this"></a>
But I thought that <span lang="zh-Hant">是</span> means "is", and <span lang="zh-Hant">也</span>, "also".
</h3>
<p>
Forget everything you learnt in Mandarin class; that is modern vernacular.
Welcome to pre-twentieth-century Chinese Literature, in which
<span lang="zh-Hant">是</span> primarily means "this", and <span lang="zh-Hant">也</span> is primarily an ending
speech-assist word (with no inherent meaning) which asserts
the preceding thing/notion/statement.
</p>
<p>
In Hong Kong you might see <span lang="zh-Hant">是日例湯</span> written on a chalkboard
for soup at an eatery.
Here <span lang="zh-Hant"><span class="highlighted-part">是</span>日</span> means "<span class="highlighted-part">this</span> day", i.e.&nbsp;"today".
