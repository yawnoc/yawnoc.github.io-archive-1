Conway's site: https://yawnoc.github.io

Built using [Conway's markdown (CMD)][cmd].

## Building

````bash
$ cmd
$ ./minify-resources
$ ./sitemap.py
````

## Testing

I recommend npm http-server,
since it supports clean URLs (default extension `.html`)
and serves `404.html` if a file is not found.
